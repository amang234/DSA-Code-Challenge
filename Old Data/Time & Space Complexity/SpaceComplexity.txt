What is Space Complexity?
Memory Space
Big-Oh Notation

Auxiliary Space + Input Space
Auxiliary Space -> Space that you take to solve the problem
Input Space -> Space that you take to store the input
Ex: a,b    {input space}
    c=a+b  {Auxiliary space}
int a[N];   O(N)    

Note: a,b;  b=a+b;  This will save your data
But never do this to input as it would manipulate the data
So if youre working for a bigger MNC then 
that can cause an issue

CP CC CS GFG  have their server for running code
Code is run from those servers
Most of them takes 1s for 10^8 operations
2s = 2*10^8 operaions
3s = 3*10^8 operaions
TC =1s similar to O(10^8) [if you go for a coding round]
